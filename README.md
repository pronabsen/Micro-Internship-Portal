## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5

- **Internships**: Available opportunities with details, requirements, and application counts
- **Applications**: Student applications with status and cover letters
- **Reviews**: Ratings and feedback between users and employers

## 🔐 Authentication

The application simulates authentication using LocalStorage:
- User sessions are maintained in the browser
- Passwords are stored in plain text (for demo purposes only)
- In a production environment, proper hashing and server-side validation would be required

## 🎮 Gamification

- **Points System**: Earn points for completing internships

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real Backend Integration**: Connect to a PHP/MySQL backend as specified in the original requirements
- **Real-time Notifications**: Implement WebSocket for instant notifications
- **Chat System**: Enable communication between users and employers
- **Payment Integration**: Add payment processing for paid internships
- **AI Recommendations**: Implement AI-based internship matching
- **Advanced Gamification**: More badges, achievements, and rewards
